	Description:  (Bubble Sort) The bubble sort presented in Fig. 6.15 is inefficient for large arrays. Make the following simple modifications to improve its performance.
						a) After the first pass, the largest number is guaranteed to be in the highest-numbered 
							element of the array; after the second pass, the two highest numbers are “in place,” and
							so on. Instead of making nine comparisons on every pass, modify the bubble sort to
							make eight comparisons on the second pass, seven on the third pass and so on.
